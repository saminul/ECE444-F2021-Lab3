### Functional Requirements


One functional requirement I would like to see is being able to view courses based on a more specific search criteria. Such as: being able to chose "ECE Area 6" or search for "AI Minor" and get relevant results.


### Non-functional Requirements


For the non-functional requirement, I would want to improve the CORRECTNESS of the system. It is important that the course information shown to the users is correct and up-to date. For example in the ECE444 page for the system, it looks like the pre-requisistes are ECE344 AND ECE353(see screenshot below) but it actually is either one of the courses so the information is not correctly portrayed.
